# SERVER ADDRESS
# Address that NSCA has to bind to in case there are
# more as one interface and we do not want NSCA to bind
# (thus listen) on all interfaces.

# I think w're gonna listen on all interfaces, for now
# server_address=192.168.1.1

# NOTE: These option is ignored if NSCA is running under either inetd or xinetd
nsca_user=nagios
nsca_group=nagios

# NSCA CHROOT
# If specified, determines a directory into which the nsca daemon
# will perform a chroot(2) operation before dropping its privileges.
# for the security conscious this can add a layer of protection in
# the event that the nagios daemon is compromised.
#
# NOTE: if you specify this option, the command file will be opened
#       relative to this directory.
#nsca_chroot=/var/run/nagios/rw

# This option determines whether or not debugging messages are logged to the syslog facility.
debug=1

command_file=/var/lib/nagios3/rw/nagios.cmd

# AGGREGATED WRITES OPTION
# This option determines whether or not the nsca daemon will
# aggregate writes to the external command file for client
# connections that contain multiple check results.  If you
# are queueing service check results on remote hosts and
# sending them to the nsca daemon in bulk, you will probably
# want to enable bulk writes, as this will be a bit more
# efficient.
# Values: 0 = do not aggregate writes, 1 = aggregate writes
aggregate_writes=0

# Donut Change!!
append_to_file=0

# MAX PACKET AGE OPTION
# This option is used by the nsca daemon to determine when client
# data is too old to be valid.  Keeping this value as small as
# possible is recommended, as it helps prevent the possibility of
# "replay" attacks.  This value needs to be at least as long as
# the time it takes your clients to send their data to the server.
# Values are in seconds.  The max packet age cannot exceed 15
# minutes (900 seconds).  If this variable is set to zero (0), no
# packets will be rejected based on their age.

max_packet_age=30



# DECRYPTION PASSWORD
# This is the password/passphrase that should be used to descrypt the
# incoming packets.  Note that all clients must encrypt the packets
# they send using the same password!
# IMPORTANT: You don't want all the users on this system to be able
# to read the password you specify here, so make sure to set
# restrictive permissions on this config file!

password=<%= @authkey %>

# ENCRYPTION METHODS
# 	0 = None	(Do NOT use this option)
#   1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
#   2 = DES
#   3 = 3DES (Triple DES)

#	5 = CAST-256
#	6 = xTEA
#	7 = 3WAY
