vm_stats
===============

Python module for ganglia 3.1.

This module allows you to collect VM metrics.
are values that are collected from

/proc/vmstat


Install
===============

Copy vm_stats.py from python_modules to your python modules directory e.g.

/usr/lib64/ganglia/python_modules

and vm_stats.pyconf to

/etc/ganglia/conf.d/

If you would like only specific metrics emitted you will need to comment out the name_match section

  metric {
    name = "vm_numa_interleave"
    title = "NUMA interleave"
    value_threshold = 1.0
  }

Restart Gmond and you are done.
