#   appName = /path/to/library
#   appName:prefix = /some/prefix (optional)
#
# Path: the path may be as simple as "appName" is the appName.so is in the apps directory
# of the distribution.  If it is not, an absolute path is required.  Keep in mind that ".so"
# is not required.
#
# Keep in mind that the app name here directly references the settings section for the
# specified application.  For example, if the app is named "appName", then there should
# be a configuration section [appName] specifying all the config options for the app.
# As such, the application names MUST be unique.

# Cluster MAY NOT have a prefix applied to it: it prefixes itself, and it relies on its
# own prefixed events.
